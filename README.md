MotorPH Payroll System

Welcome to the MotorPH Payroll System

Key Features

1. Gross Wage Calculation: The system simplifies the process of computing each employeeâ€™s gross wage. By inputting the hourly rate along with the total hours worked, users can easily determine the pre-tax earnings for each individual, ensuring accurate financial planning and payroll preparation.

2. Net Wage Calculation: After calculating gross wages, this feature takes into account various deductions, including taxes and other withholdings, to derive the net wage. This step is crucial as it guarantees that employees receive their correct take-home pay after mandatory deductions, contributing to transparent and reliable compensation practices.
